records of Sora in South America during the northern Summer


I've been fortunate the past few years to get to see some of the amazing collections of Rallidae at some exceptional museums. When visiting the American Museum of Natural History in Spring 2016 I noticed that they had Sora (_Porzana carolina_) from south/central american during the northern summer, while the species account for Sora suggests that they only winter in this area. It wasn't a large number of individuals but it got me thinking. Now whenever I visit mueums I try to take the time to look through their Sora and see what they have. Not sure where this is going, but this question is itching around in the back of my head.
